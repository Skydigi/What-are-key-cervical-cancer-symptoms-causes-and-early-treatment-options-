Cervical cancer begins when abnormal cells grow in the cervix, most often triggered by persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). Early disease is often silent, so regular screening is vital. Warning signs to watch include abnormal vaginal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or post-menopause), watery or foul-smelling discharge, pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, and unusually heavy or prolonged periods. While these symptoms can arise from non-cancer causes, any new or persistent change should be evaluated promptly. Major risk factors include HPV exposure, smoking, weakened immunity, long-term use of oral contraceptives, and skipping Pap/HPV tests. Prevention centers on HPV vaccination, condom use, and routine screening. When screening finds precancerous changes (CIN), outpatient treatments—cryotherapy, laser ablation, or LEEP—can remove abnormal cells before they progress. Early cervical cancers may be treated with conization, simple or radical hysterectomy, or fertility-sparing trachelectomy for select patients. For more advanced disease, chemoradiation is common, sometimes followed by additional therapy. Supportive care—pain control, nutrition, mental health support, and structured follow-up—improves quality of life and outcomes. Bottom line: vaccinate on time, keep up with screening, and seek care quickly for abnormal bleeding or discharge; timely action saves lives.
